## ‚úèÔ∏è About:
### Definition:
  A red-black tree is a binary search tree, balanced (h=log(n)) and self-adjusting that preserves the following rules:
  - Each node is assigned a Red (R) or Black (B) color;
  - If v is a NULL node or root, then v.color() == B;
  - If v is a node and v.color() == R, then v.leftChild().color() == B and v.rightChild().color() == B;
  - All paths from a node v to its external descendants (NULL nodes) have the same number of black nodes.
