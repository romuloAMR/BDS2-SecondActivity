# Red-Black Tree
  > C++ implementation

## üìö Software requirements:
  - g++ (Ubuntu 13.3.0-6ubuntu2~24.04) 13.3.0;

## ‚úÖ How to test:
  Move to RBTree dir and execute:
  ```
  make
  ```

## ‚úèÔ∏è About:
### Definition:
  A red-black tree is a binary search tree, balanced (h=log(n)) and self-adjusting that preserves the following rules:
  - Each node is assigned a Red (R) or Black (B) color;
  - If v is a NULL node or root, then v.color() == B;
  - If v is a node and v.color() == R, then v.leftChild().color() == B and v.rightChild().color() == B;
  - All paths from a node v to its external descendants (NULL nodes) have the same number of black nodes.
### Basic operations:
#### 1 - ROTATIONS:
##### 1.1 - Left rotation:
  Let A,B,C,D ‚àà RBTree, such that A<D<B<C and A is root.  
  Left rotation works as in the following image:

##### 1.2 - Right rotation:
  Let A,B,C,D ‚àà RBTree, such that C>D>B>A and C is root.  
  Right rotation works as in the following image:

##### 1.3 - Double left rotation:
  Let A,B,C ‚àà RBTree, such that A>B>C and A is root.  
  Double left rotation works as in the following image:

##### 1.4 - Double right rotation:
  Let A,B,C ‚àà RBTree, such that A<B<C and C is root.
