## ✏️ About:
### Definition:
  A binary tree, T, is a finite set of elements called vertices (or nodes), such that:  
  (i) T = ∅ (the tree is said to be empty)  
  or  
  (ii) There is a special node, r called the root of the tree T and the remaining remaining nodes are divided into two disjoint sets, the left and right subtree of r, each a binary tree. Each a binary tree.
